      <h2>Solar Eclipse Traffic Disparities in Pennsylvania</h2>
      <p>
        The recent solar eclipse gave us rare but expected glimpse at unusual traffic disparities in PA. I used
        PennDOT's
        <a href="https://gis.penndot.gov/tire">Traffic Information Repository (TIRe)</a> to map and graph the hourly
        directional traffic volume from April 8th. Below is a map of the locations of traffic counters for this post. I picked a sampling of counters in a variety of locations on highways going roughly north and south.
      </p>

      <p>My family travelled through this Route 15 counter around 6 pm. Tioga county is pretty rural and this road is usually empty.  </p>

        A good follow-up project could be to compare the elipse to other events that cause this type of traffic
        disparities, like a Penn State game or the Papal visit. If you have any events in mind to rival April 8th, send
        them my way.
